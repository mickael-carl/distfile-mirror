<h1 class="my-4">Introduction</h1>

<p>The Distfile Mirror service is a generic tool for mirroring artifacts
from the Internet, so that they are available internally. The goals for
having such a service are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>To improve the speed and reliability at which these artifacts are
available. It allows build processes that automatically download
third-party artifacts (e.g., <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>,
<a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a>) to work efficiently.</li>
<li>To reduce the amount of Internet bandwidth consumed.</li>
<li>To provide permanent, durable storage of these artifacts. The
Internet provides no guarantee that artifacts remain available, nor
whether they remain unmodified. The intent of this service is to keep
files stores indefinitely once they are downloaded. Depending on such
resources directly risks reproducibility of work.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>As this service provides no forms of authorization, it may only be
used to mirror artifacts that are publicly available.</b></p>

<h1 class="my-4">Using this service</h1>

<p>The Distfile Mirror service consists of two user visible parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The administration page (i.e., the page you are visiting) that can
be used to explore artifacts that are currently stored. It can also be
used to set up new artifacts that need to be mirrored. Artifacts may be
managed by type (e.g., plain files, Docker container images) by choosing
one of the menu options at the top of this page.</li>
<li>A HTTP proxy that can be used to access the artifacts stored by this
service through their original URLs. Any SSL connection established
through this service uses an auto-generated certificate that is signed
by the same Certificate Authority.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many Linux-based applications may be configured to access the HTTP
proxy by setting the following environment variables:</p>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <pre style="margin: 0">export HTTP_PROXY={{.ProxyPublicAddress}}
export HTTPS_PROXY={{.ProxyPublicAddress}}</pre>
  </div>
</div>
